# NAPE Operations

Contains all operations-related concerns for NAPE.   This includes all configuration files or integration, deployment, and delivery.

## Why a seperate repo?

I like to separate the source code from other related things. This isn't common yet. Why do I like this? The source code and related operations change at different rates. I think NAPE will get more complicated in the future. So, I want to divide the source code and operations code. This way, I can change them independently and track the changes made to each of them separately.
